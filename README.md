# what should my library mod be?

### THIS IS A FABRIC MOD, PLEASE DON'T ASK ABOUT PORTING TO (NEO)FORGE!

This is just another library mod, nothing special.

You can download this Minecraft library mod at [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/wsmlmb), [Curseforge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wsmlmb) or here on [GitHub](https://github.com/AnAwesomGuy/wsmlmb).

This library depends on [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), but you should already have that installed.

## ðŸ”½ If you want to use this library in your mod, see below! ðŸ”½
### IF YOU ARE NOT A MOD DEV USING THIS LIBRARY, THIS ***DOES NOT*** AFFECT YOU! YOU CAN IGNORE THIS!

This mod is a library mod with 4 main features:

 - the ability to create functional custom chests with custom textures.
 - the ability to create functional custom shears by adding your item into the `#c:shears` tag.
 - the ability to create functional custom crafting tables.
 - many useful utilities for support over multiple versions.

To use this mod as a library, you can use [Modrinth's maven](https://docs.modrinth.com/maven):
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://api.modrinth.com/maven" }
}

dependencies {
    modImplementation "maven.modrinth:wsmlmb:${wsmlmb_version}"
}
```

Many of the classes and methods in this mod are already documented in the test mod and JavaDocs.

For adding custom chests, see the [TexturedChestBlock](src/main/java/net/anawesomguy/wsmlmb/block/chest/TexturedChestBlock.java) class and method, and read their JavaDocs.<br>
You can do that same for custom crafting tables at [CustomCraftingTableBlock](src/main/java/net/anawesomguy/wsmlmb/block/CustomCraftingTableBlock.java).

To add custom shears, simply add your `ShearsItem` to the `#c:shears` tag.

For support over multiple versions, see the methods in [WSMLMBUtil](src/main/java/net/anawesomguy/wsmlmb/util/WSMLMBUtil.java) and the [MultiVersionBlockSettings](src/main/java/net/anawesomguy/wsmlmb/block/MultiVersionBlockSettings.java) and [MultiVersionItemSettings](src/main/java/net/anawesomguy/wsmlmb/item/MultiVersionItemSettings.java) classes.

### Every major version (1.x.x -> 2.x.x) will have breaking changes, so make your dependencies for only one major version!
